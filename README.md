### About :
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is an important technology to enable and improve the human-human and human-computer interactions. This technology allows users of information systems to speak entries rather than punching numbers on a keyboard.This field has grown exponentially over the past decade, the ASR systems are used in a wide range of applications extending from finance to healthcare. It is an important research area for human-to-machine communication.

Given the popularity and demand of this technology, here is an attempt to create a simple speech recognition system that takes our voice as input and produces the corresponding text by hearing the input by using Wav2Vec2.0â€“ a-state-of-the-art speech recognition approach by Facebook and Hugging Face model hub.
